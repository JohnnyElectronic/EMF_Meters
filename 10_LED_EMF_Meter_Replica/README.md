# 10 LED EMF Meter Replica - Olivia's Meter

- [Original perfboard r1](r1/)
- [New Updated Version on custom PCB](r2/)

Here is the documentation and support files for the Supernatural 10 LED EMF Meter Replica that Olivia used in season 4 episode 2. 
To assemble this circuit board you must be comfortable working with and soldering electronic parts.

This meter was only shown in one episode of the series but was a very standout meter. This is a prop only version with no EMF detection abilities. 
This is truly a unique meter. The meter has a test button similar to the other EMF meter for creating custom EMF events and also has 9 pre-programmed event sequences. 
These pre-programmed sequences can be added to or changed by reprogramming the ATtiny code.

An ATTiny is used to control the DFPlayer sound board and the analog meter deflection.
Programming is done through either a ICSP or UPDI programming interface depending on version.
