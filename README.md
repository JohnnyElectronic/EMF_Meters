These meters are replicas of the ones seen in the Supernatural TV series.

* Sam and Deans Classic EMF Meter
This is the classic meter seen in many of the Supernatural episodes. It can be configured with 4 or 5 capacitors at the top, supports a variety of variable resistors and 9v or AA batteries.
This meter is a functional EMF meter and can detect Electric and Magnetic fields. It also has a test button to create EMF events any time.

* Olivia's 10 LED EMF Meter
This meter was only shown in one episode of the series but was a very standout meter. This is a prop only version with no EMF detection abilities. It was hand crafted on perfboard using point to point solder connections.
This is truly a one-of-a-kind meter. The meter has a test button similar to the other EMF meter for creating custom EMF events and also has 3 pre-programmed event sequences. These pre-programmed sequences can be added to or changed by reprogramming the ATtiny85 code.
